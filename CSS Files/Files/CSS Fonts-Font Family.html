Generic Font Families
In CSS there are five generic font families:

1)Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
2)Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
3)Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
4)Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
5)Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families.

The CSS font-family Property
In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.

Note: If the font name is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".

Tip: The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma. Read more about fallback fonts in the next chapter.
