Styling Links
Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font-family, background, etc.).
In addition, links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.

The four links states are:
a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:
a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
a:active MUST come after a:hover
